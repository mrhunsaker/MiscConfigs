# Miscellaneous Configurations for my Workflows
These are just put in place so I have somewhere to copy and paste my .zshrc and init files rather than constantly having to recreate them from scratch. 



## General Workflows

### Windows 11

- Screenreader development
- Document formatting
- Print to ePub3.0 conversion for Windows environments

### OpenSUSE / RPM-based distros

- General Python development (write GUI-based data collection programs to suit my needs)
- General Optical Character Recognition (Small Projects)
- Math Character Recognition
- Print (math and literary) to Braille Transcription using command line tools
- Screenreader development

### Debian / Ubuntu

- OCR-D pipeline associated with Optical Character Recognition (High Throughput OCR)
  - I prefer to have this as a local installation rather than a podman or docker container since in my hands it causes less memory consumption. I also have not yet been able to get the local installation to work on an rpm-based distribution
